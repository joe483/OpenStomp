# OpenStomp
Control software for a MIDI stomp boxes. This is very alpha and is currently hard-coded for my stomp box. In the future support for many different stomp box sizes will be introduced.

This project is designed to interface with an Arduino stomp box built by the user. Details on how to construct the button box and how the serial-based communication works will be released on the future. It is designed to be as simple and universal as possible.

This is my first Go project so the code quality is poor since I have no idea what I'm doing yet. Code comments are also lackluster. This will be fixed as the project develops.
